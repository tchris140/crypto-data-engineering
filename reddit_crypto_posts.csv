1joz2yl,AMA with Pedro - Founder @ WalletConnect,"Hi r/CryptoCurrency community, let's kickoff this AMA!

I'm Pedro, founder of [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network) and director of the WalletConnect Foundation. I've been building in crypto since 2017 and I've started WalletConnect back in 2018 to solve the user experience for wallets!

With the recent launch of the WCT token there has been a lot of great developments and progress decentralizing and growing the WalletConnect Network which continues to improve onchain UX.

Please share your questions below in this thread and I will do my best to answer as many questions as possible

Make sure to ask only questions relevant to WCT, WalletConnect Network, our ecosystem, tokenomics, WCT, our Foundation, decentralized governance, the WalletConnect roadmap, etc

PS - We already announced that WCT will be transferable this month, April 2025, so please do not repeat the same questions about transferability or listing.",27,36,1743522922.0

1jp56f1,"If Bitcoin becomes centralized to just a few American companies, then what's the point?","Like why would I want America to start a huge Bitcoin reserve? Or for Microstrategy and Blackrock to just keep buying more and more BTC?

I feel like the purpose of crypto is dying. I feel like crypto had potential to be the largest transfer of wealth between generations and classes of all time, but it's become just another playground for the ultra-wealthy. It's no different from any other asset none of us can afford. 

It's like when your mom finds out what a slang word means and then starts saying it too much and it stops being cool. ",394,285,1743537487.0
1joyanw,Binance is listing absolute garbage shitcoins just to farm fees — and it’s time someone called them out.,"Let’s be real: These coins aren’t being listed for innovation. They’re being listed because someone paid for exposure. Marketing-first, utility-never. Binance doesn’t care if it’s trash. If the team pays, if the pump looks good, they’ll list it. Doesn’t matter if it’s a rug waiting to happen,  Because they make money off every click, every trade, every fool who buys the top. It’s profit on both sides — pump and dump. losers - Retail. Every time. This isn’t a listing strategy. 

It’s a monetization funnel. Trash in, hype out, liquidity in, users out. Binance has gotten too comfortable Too big. Too untouchable. They think no matter what they list, you’ll still show up, Because they’re the biggest. Sometimes, a monopoly needs to be shaken. **Sometimes the top exchange needs to be threatened. So they stop acting like a casino with bannersand start acting like they give a damn.** Binance needs to be reminded: **Users built you. Users can leave.** But only if we stop treating shitcoin listings like normal.

1jpkgsu,"Just wanna know your takes on On-Chain revolution in finance, guys.","Traditional finance has long been characterized by a combination of inefficiencies, intermediaries, and centralization. Despite DeFi's expansion, we continue to deal with disjointed ecosystems, exorbitant fees, and platforms that fall short of offering genuine cross-chain accessibility. 

But what if a change is about to occur?  Imagine a system where traders don't have to worry about centralized risks or off-chain dependencies since asset management, brokerage, and liquidity all work together smoothly across blockchains.  

Everything is starting to fit together.  In order to make finance truly decentralized, more initiatives are attempting to close these gaps.  Although it won't happen right away, it's obvious that infrastructure, efficiency, and interoperability will be key components of the next wave of DeFi, rather than merely staking and farming.

The real question is, will you be prepared for this transition when it occurs?  I'd love to get your ideas on what the largest hurdle to DeFi is right now.

Numbers as of April 1, 2025 - 14:00 UTC

  


**GT (Gate.io)** emerged as the standout performer, surging 32.9% and proving its resilience in a tough market. 

https://preview.redd.it/1gs8q6vtqdse1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8641358a554db9f1c2fef7d5e17f1ade9df0cfb

**WBT (WhiteBIT)** climbed 13.8%, rising from $24.6 to $28, while **LEO (Bitfinex)** gained a steady 9.7%. 

https://preview.redd.it/1lsvjfdeqdse1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c3325f626586ae79097757e2698888518c4f2c

  
**KCS (KuCoin)** eked out a modest 0.8% uptick, barely staying in the green. On the downside, **CRO (Crypto.com)** and **BGB (Bitget)** took heavy hits, dropping 29.9% and 23.1%, respectively. Even the mighty **BNB (Binance)** couldn’t escape the slump, shedding 4.9%—a surprising dip given its massive user base.

  


The DEX space was a bloodbath, with no tokens posting gains. **RUNE (Thorchain)** suffered the steepest fall, plummeting 75.9%, followed by **SUSHI (SushiSwap)** at 60.4% and **UNI (Uniswap)** and **GNO (Gnosis)** both down 57.2%. **XLM (Stellar)** and **CAKE (PancakeSwap)** held up slightly better but still lost 36.6% and 29.8%, respectively. These brutal declines signal potential cracks in community confidence, especially as bullish sentiment failed to materialize.

**Key Takeaway:** CEX tokens showed mixed results, with GT and WBT leading the charge, but the broader market leaned bearish. DEX tokens, meanwhile, got hammered across the board, highlighting a stark contrast in performance. Is this a temporary dip or a sign of deeper troubles ahead? Q2 will tell

Whenever I open Browser, Metamask opens in new tab with fishy URL. Is this legitimate? Recently only, I've been encountering this issue. I almost entered my Metamask wallet password but thankfully noticed the URL. Why is this happening? Is it a phishing attempt or something else? How can I disable this behavior to prevent it from happening again? I checked my extensions, nothing fishy is there.

1jpdh2l,Advice for Implementing a Decentralized Posting Platform,"Hi everyone,

I've been exploring an idea for a decentralized platform focused on decentralized information sharing, categorized by country (using the 195 countries as categories). The core concept is similar to Bitcoin's ledger idea, but instead of financial transactions, users post information snippets (publicly or privately) within a specific country's ""channel"". The idea is that it would completely be decentralized, meaning no government can manipulate the information present within the seed that was generated. I am trying to decide whether I should make it Proof of Work or Proof of stake. This way, information that was shared would 100% be ensured that it has not been tampered with.

Another idea is that instead of just focusing on decentralized information sharing within countries, we can extend this so that we get decentralized reddit, where every subreddit would also (in this context, become decentralized). However, this is one of the best ways to ensure that information can not be manipulated (whether it is by a reddit moderator or someone else). It is very simple, but if it succeeds it can be quite effective, because we can open source it, and people would implement an even better version of having a real 'decentralized reddit where information can not be controlled by outside sources, especially ones that abuse their authority for the purpose of misinformation''.

So if anyone of you have any thoughts you would like to share, would appreciate some advice on the different frameworks and sources in implementing this mini-side project.",1,1,1743559629.0
1jp80lm,Solid crypto community?,"Looking for a solid crypto community… Just a group of folks who are passionate/interested and knowledgeable/teachable within the altcoin market especially. The issue I keep running into is with all of these discord servers it’s one of two things:

-poorly maintained, has just become a typical chat group posting memes with a few bots talking about xrp 
-a group that has evolved into a platform to sell memberships or guru guides for buy/sell signals
(Which hell, I wouldn’t mind if I knew they’d work)

I follow some profiles on X/twitter, and I think I have weeded out some of the noise on there, but some recommendations for legit accounts would be nice. 

Reddit ends up being better than discord because of these aforementioned issues, and x, despite being minute-to-minute is so cluttered with BS it can be tricky to navigate through.

So yeh, any good recommendations for communities of mostly real people on X, Discord, Reddit, etc?
(Asking specifically about alt coins, though crypto in general, technical analysis, market analysis, stocks, forex, etc would also be appreciated)

1jpj727,I built a profitable API bot that doesn’t use stop-loss — everything is logic-based. Open to feedback,"Waking up to Telegram TP hits feels better than caffeine — built a bot that trades while I sleep. built this python bot, because I was tired of getting wicked out by stop-losses in volatile markets.

I didn’t want another EMA crossover or RSI 30/70 script. I needed something smarter — a system that reacts based on structure, not prediction. So I built a ladder-based bot that manages entries and exits without using stop-loss at all. Instead, it uses adaptive take-profits and reacts to market conditions using config-based logic.

Here’s what it does 

No stop-loss — risk is managed through take-profit scaling and size control

You can choose between:

 partial ladder mode (each TP calculated per rung)

 full ladder mode (single TP for the whole position)

 hybrid mode (auto flips LONG/SHORT based on RSI & EMA)

Dynamically adjusts TP of existing rungs when new ones are added

 it always updates the most distant ladder — keeps the structure tight

Smart TP scaling:

So large new orders drag older TP targets into more realistic zones

 Everything is configurable (from config.json):

Trading symbol, timeframe, leverage

RSI logic (length, OB/OS, reset levels)

TP percentage

Ladder scaling factor (exponential or fixed size)

Whether to use drop-ladder adding on price dips

Minimum ladders before scaling triggers

EMA filter: restricts trades based on trend direction

And you can even choose whether TPs use WAP or simple entry prices



How it behaves in practice:

Runs off Binance WebSocket — reacts live to price

When you open a new ladder, the bot updates existing TP targets if needed

If the position closes or partial TPs hit, it resets the scaling logic

It tracks and updates the last rungs with biggest distance from price

Old ladders don't just sit there forgotten — the bot keeps pulling them into play dynamically

Telegram notifications are integrated for every major event (TP hits, resets, new entries)

I’ve tested this in both low-volatility, trend market and fast-swing markets.

It doesn’t “guess” direction — it builds and adjusts. No emotions. No SL. Just logic.

If you're into ladder bots, scalping systems, or reactive trading mechanics — this setup might give you a few ideas.

  
And honestly? I’m proud of it. There’s something weirdly satisfying about seeing those Telegram pings while you’re asleep — our bots working like bees, closing TP after TP while you do absolutely nothing No panic, no charts, no rush — just logic, structure, and that clean little “click” sound from Telegram that says: ""**Yeah. We got another one.""**

If you’re working on something similar or want to see how the TP dragging works in detail, feel free to hit me up.
